Introduction 

- The dataset we have chosen comes from the Public Health Scotland website, where NHS organisations can use the platform to publish and share their own datasets that meet the requirements set out in the Scottish Government Open Data Strategy.

- Before data is released it is first assessed for statistical disclosure to ensure the data is reliable and as accurate as possible.

Cases and Variables 

Each individual case (id), in this data set represents an individual patient.

Some of the key the variables in this data set include:

- FiniancialYear: Financial years start on 1 April and end on 31 March. For example, financial year 2017/2018 covers the period 1 April 2017 â€“ 31 March 2018.

- AgeGroup: Refers to the patient's age on admission. Ages have been arranged in five different groups.

- Sex: The patient's sex, as recorded on admission.

- DischargeCount: The total number of discharges. A hospital discharge marks the end of an episode of care. Discharges include deaths, transfers to other specialties/significant facilities and hospitals, and discharges home or to other regular place of residence.

- PatientCount: The total number of patients. A patient is defined as an individual discharged from hospital (including as a transfer out) at least once during the financial year. Regardless of how many times they have been discharged during the financial year, patients are counted only once in each financial year at the Scotland level. However, if their age band and/or sex changes during the year, they will be counted more than once.

Data Analysis Plan


The four main variables we will be focusing our analysis on will be:

1. Age Group 
2. Sex 
3. Discharge Count 
4. Patient count 

Comparison Groups:

- There are 5 comparable sub-groups within the "AgeGroup" variable; (0-17, 18-24, 25-39, 40-64 and 65+)

- There are 2 comparable sub-groups within the "Sex" variable; (male and female)

Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r, echo = FALSE}

ggplot(age_and_sex, aes(x = AgeGroup, y = PatientsCount)) +
geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Amount of Patients for different AgeGroups")
```
---
```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(age_and_sex, aes(x = AgeGroup, y = DischargeCount)) +
geom_point()+
  labs(title = "Amount of Discharge for different AgeGroups")


```
---
```{r, echo = FALSE}
age_and_sex %>%  
  select(DischargeCount) %>% 
  summarise(avg_ds = mean(DischargeCount),
            max_ds = max(DischargeCount),
            min_ds = min(DischargeCount)) 

```
Key Summary Statistics:

Average Discharge Count = 284
Maximum Discharge Count = 11750
Minimum Discharge Count = 0

Sammary

- 40~64 AgeGroup
 - highest count on both graphs
 
- 65+ AgeGroup
 - 2nd highest count on both graphs
 - DischargeCount is much lower than PatientCount
